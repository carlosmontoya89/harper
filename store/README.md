# Store

This package contains implementation of model stores

## Convention

To create a store for a model, just create a top level folder for the model.
For example, **user** then, create a subfolder for the store implementation.
For example, **user/bbolt**, **user/memory** etc.

## TODO

* Write tests for stores
